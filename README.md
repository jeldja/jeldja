- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jeldja. My name is Jelovy Djaja.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in combining creativity and coding to solve important challenges in modern society.
I want to apply the skills I learn to revolutionize technology, products, and software that would help improve
lives of the under represented communities and just communities throughout the world! A lot of my current
repositories/projects are currently private but I will put them on public once it's done! :)))))
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology. (It's really fun!)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me , Email: jelovyadjaja@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm ambidextrous! 

I hope you enjoy this journey as I apply the skills I learn to projects and grow in knowledge together! :)
